# StaticSite
Static site generator guided project from Boot.dev 

Boot.dev supplied a guided practice to teach me how to make a static site generator from the ground up.
The current verion of my project is the completed project. In the future I will make my own changes and adjustments.

## Future revision ideas
* add multiple pages of custom content 
* host the website on a server
